# 2. COMMENTS
print("COMMENTS")
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("This string will show in your output.")
# and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")
print("This will run.")

# Comments are good for turning code "off" and "on"
# But mostly they are used as reminders and explanations
