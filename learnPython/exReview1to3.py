# Exercise 1 Review. The print command

# Exercise 2 Review. The Comment
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("EXERCISE 2 REVIEW - COMMENTS")
print("This statement will show in your ouput.")
# and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")
print("This will run.")

# Comments are good for turning code "off" and "on"
# But mostly they are used as reminders and explanations

# Exercise 3 Review. Math in Python
print("EXERCISE 3 REVIEW - MATH")
# A statement followed by a math calculation
# Notice that the math does not have quotes. Important!

# Math symbols get spaces before and after them
# To make it easier to read
